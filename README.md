# Crop-Production-and-Yield-Analysis
**Problem Statement**: This project analyzes agricultural crop production data from various states and districts in India over multiple years. The objective is to derive valuable insights into the performance of different crops, their production trends, and the efficiency of land use (yield) using SQL and visualize the findings using Power BI/Tableau. The dataset includes detailed information such as crop type, area cultivated, production quantity, season, and year, making it ideal for advanced data analysis and reporting.

**Task**:
Calculate crop yield (production per unit area) to assess which crops are the most efficient in production.
calculates the year-over-year percentage growth in crop production for each state and crop.
calculates each state's average yield (production per area) and identifies the top N states with the highest average yield over multiple years.
calculates the variance in production across different crops and states. (tip: use VAR function).
Identifies states that have the largest increase in cultivated area for a specific crop between two years

**Action**: Analyzed data using SQL and PowerBI to track Crop yield, YOY trends,States Average yield and production Varience 

**Result**:
1.Sugarcane have the highest yield i.e., 40000 kg/ha making it the most efficient crop in terms of production per unit area. coconut,onion and maize are few more crops efficient in production.
2.Puducherry,Kerala,Punjab,Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Goa are top 5 states with hishest average yield over multiple years.
3.Arecanut,banana,Arhar/tur etc are crops which shows high varience in production in the states like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh.
4.Kerala,Andrapradesh,Tamil Nadu,Uttar Pradesh and Assam are the top 5 states with highest crop production.
5.Kerala contributes 73.8 % in the production and Coconut is majorly grown.
6.Coconut, Sugarcane, Potato,Wheat and Rice are the key crops majorly grown in the most of the states.
7.2015 was the least production year. Odissa and  Sikkim contributes to the production
